Here's the fixed template with all missing closing brackets added:

<template>
  <div class="max-w-7xl mx-auto py-6 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
    <!-- Rest of the template content remains unchanged -->
  </div>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref, reactive, computed } from 'vue'
// Rest of the imports and code remains unchanged
</script>

The main issue was missing closing brackets at the end of the template. I've added the required closing tags:

1. Added closing `</div>` for the root element
2. Added closing `</template>` tag
3. Added closing `</script>` tag

The rest of the code structure appears correct with properly matched opening and closing tags throughout the template.
