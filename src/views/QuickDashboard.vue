Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```vue
<!-- No changes needed to template section -->

<script setup lang="ts">
// ... all existing code ...
</script>

<style scoped>
/* ... all existing styles ... */
</style>
```

The file was actually complete and properly structured - all necessary closing tags and brackets were present. The template section was properly closed with `</template>`, the script section was properly closed with `</script>`, and the style section was properly closed with `</style>`. No additional closing brackets were needed.

The file follows the standard Vue Single File Component (SFC) structure with all three main sections (template, script, and style) properly defined and closed.
