Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```vue
<!-- No changes needed to template section -->

<script setup lang="ts">
// ... all existing code ...

</script>

<style scoped>
/* ... all existing styles ... */
</style>
```

The file was actually properly formatted and had all required closing tags/brackets. The template section was properly closed with `</template>`, the script section was properly closed with `</script>`, and the style section was properly closed with `</style>`. No additional closing brackets were needed.

The structure was:
1. `<template>` ... `</template>`
2. `<script setup lang="ts">` ... `</script>`
3. `<style scoped>` ... `</style>`

All component logic and markup was properly nested within these sections.
