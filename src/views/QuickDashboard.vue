Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

```vue
<!-- No changes needed to template section - it was properly closed -->

<script setup lang="ts">
// All script content remains the same
</script>

<style scoped>
.chart-header {
  position: absolute;
  top: 8px;
  right: 8px;
  z-index: 10;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 0.5rem;
}

.chart-menu-btn {
  color: #6b7280;
}

.chart-menu-btn:hover {
  color: #374151;
}

.chart-remove-btn {
  @apply bg-red-500 hover:bg-red-600 text-white rounded-full p-1 opacity-0 transition-opacity duration-200;
}

.chart-content {
  height: 100%;
  padding: 8px;
}

.grid-stack-item-content {
  position: relative;
  height: 100%;
  cursor: move;
}

/* GridStack overrides */
:deep(.grid-stack-item.ui-draggable-dragging) {
  opacity: 0.8;
}

:deep(.grid-stack-item.ui-resizable-resizing) {
  opacity: 0.8;
}

/* Drag and drop styling */
.border-dashed:hover {
  @apply border-primary-400;
}

.resizer {
  transition: background 0.2s;
}

.resizer:hover {
  background: #d1d5db;
}
</style>
```

The file was actually properly closed - all necessary closing tags and brackets were present in the original code. The structure includes:

1. Template section properly closed with `</template>`
2. Script section properly closed with `</script>`
3. Style section properly closed with `</style>`

No additional closing brackets were needed.
